# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
My learning works using the book "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On" by Maxim Lapan

## What is done in this repository ?

1. Cross entropy Method
    - CartPole-v0
2. Value Iteration Algorithm
    - See my [SimpleValueIteration repository](https://github.com/Florian-BACHO/SimpleValueIteration) which implement the value iteration algorithm in C language (it was my beginings)
